# Problem Statement 
The safety of passengers, crew, and cargo is the highest priority in aviation. Any damage to the structural integrity of an aircraft, no matter how minor, poses a potential threat to safety. Issues such as dents or structural deformities can disrupt airflow, impair aerodynamics, and weaken critical structural elements, increasing the risk of catastrophic failures during flight. Faulty wiring is another significant safety risk, as it can lead to electrical malfunctions in essential aircraft systems. These malfunctions can result in system failures, in-flight emergencies, or even fires, putting passengers, crew, and the aircraft itself in jeopardy.

Therefore, thorough assessments and repairs are essential to maintaining the airworthiness of aircraft and ensuring safety against potential accidents.
